KlipperPlace is a **Pick-and-Place–focused fork of the Klipper firmware**.

It adapts Klipper’s real-time motion control architecture for **high-precision Pick-and-Place (PnP) machines**, combining the power of a general-purpose host computer with one or more microcontrollers for deterministic motion control and I/O handling.

## Overview

KlipperPlace builds on Klipper’s proven core and extends it for machine types beyond 3D printers, with a focus on Pick-and-Place systems.

Key goals:
- Precise multi-axis motion control
- Deterministic timing for feeders, vacuum, and tool I/O
- Flexible kinematics suitable for PnP machines
- Compatibility with Klipper’s configuration and extension model

## Getting Started

Start by installing the standard Klipper software:

- Installation guide: https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html
- Features overview: https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html

Then apply the KlipperPlace-specific configuration and extensions for your Pick-and-Place machine.

## Documentation

KlipperPlace follows Klipper’s core concepts and architecture. For general usage and design details, refer to the official Klipper documentation:
